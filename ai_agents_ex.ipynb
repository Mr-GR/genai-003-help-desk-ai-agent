    "\t- Advantages:\n",
    "\t\t- Simplicity: rule-based systems are easy to design, implement, and understand. They don't require complex algorithms or learning, making them accessible for a wide range of applications.  \n",
    "\t\t- Predictability: The behavior of a rule-based system is entirely determined by its rules, making it easy to predict how it will response to different inputs. \n",
    "\t\t- Speed: Because the rule-based systems don't perform data processing or learning they can response quickly, making them ideal for applications that require immediate actions. \n",
    "\t- Disadvantages: \n",
    "\t\t- Limited flexibility: Rule-bases systems can only handle scenarios that match predefined rules. They struggle with complex or unanticipated inputs and cannot adapt to new situations. \n",
    "\t\t- Rule explosion: As the number of conditions increases, the rule base can become large and difficult to manage. This rule explosion makes it challenging to maintain and update the system. \n",
    "\t\t- Lack of learning: Rule-based systems cannot improve over time or learn from past interactions, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments or task that require adaptability. "
